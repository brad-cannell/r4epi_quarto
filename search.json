    "text": "Acknowledgements\nThis book is currently a work in progress (and probably always will be); however, there are already many people who have played an important role (some unknowingly) in helping develop it thus far. First, we’d like to offer our gratitude to all past, current, and future members of the R Core Team for maintaining this amazing, free software. We’d also like to express our gratitude to everyone at Posit. You are also developing and giving away some amazing software. In particular, we’d like to acknowledge Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Both have had a huge impact on how we use and teach R. We’d also like to thank our students for all the feedback they’ve given us while taking our courses. In particular, we want to thank Jared Wiegand and Yiqun Wang for their many edits and suggestions.\nThis electronic textbook was created and published using R, RStudio, the Quarto, and GitHub."

    "text": "Goals\nWe’re going to start the introduction by writing down some basic goals that underlie the construction and content of this book. We’re writing this for you, the reader, but also to hold ourselves accountable as we write. So, feel free to read if you are interested or skip ahead if you aren’t.\nThe goals of this book are:\n\nTo teach you how to use R and RStudio as tools for applied epidemiology.1 Our goal is not to teach you to be a computer scientist or an advanced R programmer. Therefore, some readers who are experienced programmers may catch some technical inaccuracies regarding what we consider to be the fine points of what R is doing “under the hood.”\nTo make this writing as accessible and practically useful as possible without stripping out all of the complexity that makes doing epidemiology in real life a challenge. In other words, We’re going to try to give you all the tools you need to do epidemiology in “real world” conditions (as opposed to ideal conditions) without providing a whole bunch of extraneous (often theoretical) stuff that detracts from doing. Having said that, we will strive to add links to the other (often theoretical) stuff for readers who are interested.\nTo teach you to accomplish common tasks, rather than teach you to use functions or families of functions. In many R courses and texts, there is a focus on learning all the things a function, or set of related functions, can do. It’s then up to you, the reader, to sift through all of these capabilities and decided which, if any, of the things that can be done will accomplish the tasks that you are actually trying to accomplish. Instead, we will strive to start with the end in mind. What is the task we are actually trying to accomplish? What are some functions/methods we could use to accomplish that task? What are the strengths and limitations of each?\nTo start each concept by showing you the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product.\nTo learn concepts with data instead of (or alongside) mathematical formulas and text descriptions, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts by seeing them in action."

    "text": "Typos\nThe easiest way for you to contribute is to help us clean up the little typos and grammatical errors that inevitably sneak into the text.\nIf you spot a typo, you can offer a correction directly in GitHub. You will first need to create a free GitHub account: sign-up at github.com. Later in the book, we will cover using GitHub in greater depth (See Chapter 2). Here, we’re just going to walk you through how to fix a typo without much explanation of how GitHub works.\nLet’s say you spot a typoo while reading along.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, click the edit button in the toolbar as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n🔴 Left off here. - I need to change the screenshots and the description of the process because it changes a little with Quarto. Open Safari to update the screenshots.\nThe first time you click the icon, you will be taken to the R4Epi repository on GitHub and asked to fork it. For our purposes, you can think of a GitHub repository as being similar to a shared folder on Dropbox or Google Drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Forking the repository” basically just means “make a copy of the repository” on your GitHub account. In other words, copy all of the files that make up the R4Epi textbook to your GitHub account. Then, you can fix the typos you found in your copy of the files that make up the book instead of directly editing the actual files that make up the book. This is a safeguard to prevent people from accidentally making changes that shouldn’t be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nForking the R4Epi repository does not cost any money or add any files to your computer.\n\n\nAfter you fork the repository, you will see a text editor on your screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe text editor will display the contents of the file used to make the chapter you were looking at when you clicked the edit button. In this example, it was a file named contributing.qmd. The .qmd file extension means that the file is a Quarto file. We will learn more about Quarto files in Chapter 1, but for now just know that Quarto files can be used to create web pages and other documents that contain a mix of R code, text, and images. You may not understand the code you see in the text editor yet, but you will probably be able to skim through the text and find the typo you want to fix.\nNext, scroll down through the text until you find the typo and fix it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the only thing left to do is propose your typo fix to the authors. To do so, simply scroll to the bottom of the same screen where you made the edits to the file. There, you will see a Propose changes form box you can fill out. In the first line, type a brief (i.e., 72 characters or less) summary of the change you made. There is also a box to add a more detailed description of what you did, but you shouldn’t need to use it for a simple typo fix.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, click the Propose changes button. That will take you to another screen where you will be able to create a pull request. This screen is kind of busy, but try not to let it overwhelm you.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, we will focus on the three different sections of the screen that are highlighted with a red outline. We will start at the bottom and work our way up. The red box that is closest to the bottom of the screenshot shows us that the change we made was on line 93. We removed the word “typoo” (highlighted in red) and added the word “typo” (highlighted in green). The red box in the middle of the screenshot shows us the brief description we wrote for our proposed change – “Fixed a typo in index.Rmd”. Finally, the red box closest to the top of the screenshot is surrounding the Create pull request button. Let’s go ahead and click it now.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter doing so, we will get one final chance to amend the description of our proposed changes. We don’t want to change our description, so let’s go ahead and click Create pull request one more time. Our job is done! It is now up to the authors to review the changes we’ve proposed and “pull” them into the file in their repository.\nIn case you are curious, here is what the process looks like on the authors’ end. First, when we open the R4Epi repository page on GitHub, we will see that there is a new pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we open the pull request, we can see the proposed changes to the file.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, all we have to do is click the Merge pull request button and the fixed file is “pulled in” to replace the file with the typo.\n\n\n\n\n\n🔴 Left off here. Moving over content from index.Rmd."

In R, all columns of a data frame must have the same length.\nFunctions. Coming soon.\n\nArguments: Arguments always go inside the parentheses of a function and give the function the information it needs to give us the result we want.\nPass: In programming lingo, you pass a value to a function argument. For example, in the funtion call seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 2) we could say that we passed a value of 2 to the from argument, we passed a value of 100 to the to argument, and we passed a value of 2 to the by argument.\nReturns: Instead of saying, “the seq() function gives us a sequence of numbers…” we could say, “the seq() function returns us a sequence of numbers…” In programming lingo, functions return one or more results.\n\n\nRepository\n\nGitHub’s documentation says “a repository contains all of your code, your files, and each file’s revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.”1 A repository can exist locally as a set of files on your computer. A repository can also exist remotely as a set of files on a sever somewhere, for example, on GitHub.\n\n\nGlobal environment. Coming soon.\nObjects. Coming soon.\nR. R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. R is very much a vehicle for newly developing methods of interactive data analysis. It has developed rapidly and has been extended by a large collection of packages. However, most programs written in R are essentially ephemeral, written for a single piece of data analysis.2\nR markdown documents. R markdown documents are text files that can be used to clean and analyze your data interactively as well as share your final results in many different formats (e.g., Microsoft Word, PDF, and even websites). R markdown documents weave together R code, narrative text, and multimedia content together into a polished final product.3\nRStudio. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux).4\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "Acknowledgements\nThis book is currently a work in progress (and probably always will be); however, there are already many people who have played an important role (some unknowingly) in helping develop it thus far. First, we‚Äôd like to offer our gratitude to all past, current, and future members of the R Core Team for maintaining this amazing, free software. We‚Äôd also like to express our gratitude to everyone at Posit. You are also developing and giving away some amazing software. In particular, we‚Äôd like to acknowledge Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Both have had a huge impact on how we use and teach R. We‚Äôd also like to thank our students for all the feedback they‚Äôve given us while taking our courses. In particular, we want to thank Jared Wiegand and Yiqun Wang for their many edits and suggestions.\nThis electronic textbook was created and published using R, RStudio, the Quarto, and GitHub."

    "text": "Goals\nWe‚Äôre going to start the introduction by writing down some basic goals that underlie the construction and content of this book. We‚Äôre writing this for you, the reader, but also to hold ourselves accountable as we write. So, feel free to read if you are interested or skip ahead if you aren‚Äôt.\nThe goals of this book are:\n\nTo teach you how to use R and RStudio as tools for applied epidemiology. Our goal is not to teach you to be a computer scientist or an advanced R programmer. Therefore, some readers who are experienced programmers may catch some technical inaccuracies regarding what we consider to be the fine points of what R is doing ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù\nTo make this writing as accessible and practically useful as possible without stripping out all of the complexity that makes doing epidemiology in real life a challenge. In other words, We‚Äôre going to try to give you all the tools you need to do epidemiology in ‚Äúreal world‚Äù conditions (as opposed to ideal conditions) without providing a whole bunch of extraneous (often theoretical) stuff that detracts from doing. Having said that, we will strive to add links to the other (often theoretical) stuff for readers who are interested.\nTo teach you to accomplish common tasks, rather than teach you to use functions or families of functions. In many R courses and texts, there is a focus on learning all the things a function, or set of related functions, can do. It‚Äôs then up to you, the reader, to sift through all of these capabilities and decided which, if any, of the things that can be done will accomplish the tasks that you are actually trying to accomplish. Instead, we will strive to start with the end in mind. What is the task we are actually trying to accomplish? What are some functions/methods we could use to accomplish that task? What are the strengths and limitations of each?\nTo start each concept by showing you the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product.\nTo learn concepts with data instead of (or alongside) mathematical formulas and text descriptions, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts by seeing them in action."

You will first need to create a free GitHub account: sign-up at github.com. Later in the book, we will cover using [GitHub in greater depth][Introduction to git and GitHub].

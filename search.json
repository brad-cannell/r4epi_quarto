    "text": "To teach you how to use R and RStudio as tools for applied epidemiology.1 Our goal is not to teach you to be a computer scientist or an advanced R programmer. Therefore, some readers who are experienced programmers may catch some technical inaccuracies regarding what we consider to be the fine points of what R is doing “under the hood.”\nTo make this writing as accessible and practically useful as possible without stripping out all of the complexity that makes doing epidemiology in real life a challenge. In other words, We’re going to try to give you all the tools you need to do epidemiology in “real world” conditions (as opposed to ideal conditions) without providing a whole bunch of extraneous (often theoretical) stuff that detracts from doing. Having said that, we will strive to add links to the other (often theoretical) stuff for readers who are interested.\nTo teach you to accomplish common tasks, rather than teach you to use functions or families of functions. In many R courses and texts, there is a focus on learning all the things a function, or set of related functions, can do. It’s then up to you, the reader, to sift through all of these capabilities and decided which, if any, of the things that can be done will accomplish the tasks that you are actually trying to accomplish. Instead, we will strive to start with the end in mind. What is the task we are actually trying to accomplish? What are some functions/methods we could use to accomplish that task? What are the strengths and limitations of each?\nTo start each concept by showing you the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product.\nTo learn concepts with data instead of (or alongside) mathematical formulas and text descriptions, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts by seeing them in action.",

    "text": "Typos\nThe easiest way for you to contribute is to help us clean up the little typos and grammatical errors that inevitably sneak into the text.\nIf you spot a typo, you can offer a correction directly in GitHub. You will first need to create a free GitHub account: sign-up at github.com. Later in the book, we will cover using GitHub in greater depth (See 5  Using git and GitHub). Here, we’re just going to walk you through how to fix a typo without much explanation of how GitHub works.\nLet’s say you spot a typo while reading along.\nNext, click the edit button in the toolbar as shown in the screenshot below.\nThe first time you click the icon, you will be taken to the R4Epi repository on GitHub and asked to fork it. For our purposes, you can think of a GitHub repository as being similar to a shared folder on Dropbox or Google Drive.\n“Forking the repository” basically just means “make a copy of the repository” on your GitHub account. In other words, copy all of the files that make up the R4Epi textbook to your GitHub account. Then, you can fix the typos you found in your copy of the files that make up the book instead of directly editing the actual files that make up the book. This is a safeguard to prevent people from accidentally making changes that shouldn’t be made.\nAfter you fork the repository, you will see a text editor on your screen.\nThe text editor will display the contents of the file used to make the chapter you were looking at when you clicked the edit button. In this example, it was a file named contributing.qmd. The .qmd file extension means that the file is a Quarto file. We will learn more about Quarto files in 4  Quarto Files, but for now just know that Quarto files can be used to create web pages and other documents that contain a mix of R code, text, and images.\nNext, scroll down through the text until you find the typo and fix it. In this case, line 11 contains the word “typoo”. To fix it, you just need to click in the editor window and begin typing. In this case, you would click next to the word “typoo” and delete the second “o”.\nNow, the only thing left to do is propose your typo fix to the authors. To do so, click the green Commit changes... button on the right side of the screen above the text editor (surrounded with a red box in the screenshot above). When you click it, a new Propose changes box will appear on your screen. Type a brief (i.e., 72 characters or less) summary of the change you made in the Commit message box. There is also an Extended description box where you can add a more detailed description of what you did. In the screenshot below, shows an example commit message and extended description that will make it easy for the author to quickly figure out exactly what changes are being proposed.\nNext, click the Propose changes button. That will take you to another screen where you will be able to create a pull request. This screen is kind of busy, but try not to let it overwhelm you.\nFor now, we will focus on the three different sections of the screen that are highlighted with a red outline. We will start at the bottom and work our way up. The red box that is closest to the bottom of the screenshot shows us that the change that made was on line 11. The word “typoo” (highlighted in red) was replaced with the word “typo” (highlighted in green). The red box in the middle of the screenshot shows us the brief description that was written for our proposed change – “Fix a typo in contributing.qmd”. Finally, the red box closest to the top of the screenshot is surrounding the Create pull request button. You will click it to move on with your pull request.\nAfter doing so, you will get one final chance to amend the description of your proposed changes. If you are happy with the commit message and description, then click the Create pull request button one more time. At this point, your job is done! It is now up to the authors to review the changes you’ve proposed and “pull” them into the file in their repository.\nIn case you are curious, here is what the process looks like on the authors’ end. First, when we open the R4Epi repository page on GitHub, we will see that there is a new pull request.\nWhen we open the pull request, we can see the proposed changes to the file.\nThen, all we have to do is click the Merge pull request button and the fixed file is “pulled in” to replace the file with the typo.",

    "text": "2.1 What is data?\nData is information about objects (e.g., people, places, schools) and observable phenomenon (e.g., weather, temperatures, and disease symptoms) that is recorded and stored somehow as a collection of symbols, numbers, and letters. So, data is just information that has been “written” down.\nHere we have a table, which is a common way of organizing data. In R, we will typically refer to these tables as data frames.\nEach box in a data frame is called a cell.\nMoving from left to right across the data frame are columns. Columns are also sometimes referred to as variables. In this book, we will often use the terms columns and variables interchangeably. Each column in a data frame has one, and only one, type. For now, know that the type tells us what kind of data is contained in a column and what we can do with that data. You may have already noticed that 3 of the columns in the table we’ve been looking at contain numbers and 1 of the columns contains words. These columns will have different types in R and we can do different things with them based on their type. For example, we could ask R to tell us what the average value of the numbers in the height column are, but it wouldn’t make sense to ask R to tell us the average value of the words in the Gender column. We will talk more about many of the different column types exist in R later in this book.\nThe information contained in the first cell of each column is called the column name (or variable) name.\nR gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can name our columns, but there are a few rules.\nMoving from top to bottom across the table are rows, which are sometimes referred to as records.\nFinally, the contents of each cell are called values.\nYou should now be up to speed on some basic terminology used by R, as well as other analytic, database, and spreadsheet programs. These terms will be used repeatedly throughout the course.",

    "section": "2.2 What is R?",
    "text": "2.2 What is R?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is R? Well, R is an open source statistical programming language that was created in the 1990’s specifically for data analysis. We will talk more about what open source means later, but for now, just think of R as an easy (relatively 😂) way to ask your computer to do math and statistics for you. More specifically, by the end of this book you will be able to independently use R to transfer data, manage data, analyze data, and present the results of your analysis. Let’s quickly take a closer look at each of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Transferring data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what do we mean by “transfer data”? Well, individuals and organizations store their data using different computer programs that use different file types. Some common examples that you may come across in epidemiology are database files, spreadsheets, raw data files, and SAS data sets. No matter how the data is stored, you can’t do anything with it until you can get it into R, in a form that R can use, and in a location that you can reach. In other words, transferring your data. Therefore, among our first tasks in this course will be to transfer data.\n\n\n2.2.2 Managing data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t very specific, but managing data is all the things you may have to do to your data to get it ready for analysis. You may also hear people refer to this process as data wrangling or data munging. Some specific examples of data management tasks include:\n\nValidating and cleaning data. In other words, dealing with potential errors in the data.\n\nSubsetting data. For example, using only some of the columns or some of the rows.\n\nCreating new variables. For example, creating a BMI variable in a data frame that was sent to you with height and weight columns.\n\nCombining data frames. For example, combining sociodemographic data about study participants with data collected in the field during an intervention.\n\nYou may sometimes hear people refer to the 80/20 rule in reference to data management. This “rule” says that in a typical data analysis project, roughly 80% of your time will be spent on data management and only 20% will be spent on the analysis itself. We can’t provide you with any empirical evidence (i.e., data) to back this claim up. But, as people who have been involved in many projects that involve the collection and analysis of data, we can tell you anecdotally that this ”rule” is probably pretty close to being accurate in most cases.\nAdditionally, it’s been our experience that most students of epidemiology are required to take one or more classes that emphasize methods for analyzing data; however, almost none of them have taken a course that emphasizes data management!\nTherefore, because data management is such a large component of most projects that involve the collection and analysis of data, and because most readers will have already been exposed to data analysis to a much greater extent than data management, this course will heavily emphasize the latter.\n\n\n2.2.3 Analyzing data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs just discussed, this is probably the capability you most closely associate with R, and there is no doubt that R is a powerful tool for analyzing data. However, in this book we won’t go beyond using R to calculate basic descriptive statistics. For our purposes, descriptive statistics include:\n\nMeasures of central tendency. For example, mean, median, and mode.\n\nMeasures of dispersion. For example, variance and standard error.\n\nMeasures for describing categorical variables. For example, counts and percentages.\n\nDescribing data using graphs and charts. With R, we can describe our data using beautiful and informative graphs.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Presenting data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, the ultimate goal is typically to present your findings in some form or another. For example, a report, a website, or a journal article. With R you can present your results in many different formats with relative ease. In fact, this is one of our favorite things about R and RStudio. In this class you will learn how to take your text, tabular, or graphical results and then publish them in many different formats including Microsoft Word, html files that can be viewed in web browsers, and pdf documents. Let’s take a look at some examples.\n\nMicrosoft Word documents. Click here to view an example report created for one of my research projects in Microsoft Word.\n\nPDF documents. Click here to view a data dictionary we created in PDF format.\n\nHTML files. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files are what you are looking at whenever you view a webpage. You can use R to create HTML files that others can view in their web browser. You can email them these files to view in their web browser, or you can make them available for others to view online just like any other website. Click here to view an example dashboard we created for one of my research projects.\n\nWeb applications. You can even use R to create full-fledged web applications.

    "text": "3.1 The console\nThe first pane we are going to talk about is the Console/Terminal/Jobs pane. @ref(fig:console)\nThe R console.\nIt’s called the Console/Terminal/Jobs pane because it has three tabs you can click on: Console, Terminal, and Jobs. However, we will mostly refer to it as the Console pane and we will mostly ignore the Terminal and Jobs tabs. We aren’t ignoring them because they aren’t useful; rather, we are ignoring them because using them isn’t essential for anything we discuss anytime soon, and I want to keep things as simple as possible.\nThe console is the most basic way to interact with R. You can type a command to R into the console prompt (the prompt looks like “&gt;”) and R will respond to what you type. For example, below I’ve typed “1 plus 1,” hit enter, and the R console returned the sum of the numbers 1 and 1. @ref(fig:one-plus-one)\nDoing some addition in the R console.\nThe number 1 you see in brackets before the 2 (i.e., [1]) is telling you that this line of results starts with the first result. That fact is obvious here because there is only one result. To make this idea clearer, let’s show you a result with multiple lines.\nDemonstrating a function that returns multiple results.\nIn the screenshot above we see a couple new things demonstrated. @ref(fig:seq-function)\nFirst, as promised, we have more than one line of results (or output). The first line of results starts with a 1 in brackets (i.e., [1]), which indicates that this line of results starts with the first result. In this case the first result is the number 2. The second line of results starts with a 29 in brackets (i.e., [29]), which indicates that this line of results starts with the twenty-ninth result. In this case the twenty-ninth result is the number 58. If you count the numbers in the first line, there should be 28 – results 1 through 28. I also want to make it clear that “1” and “29” are NOT results themselves. They are just helping us count the number of results per line.\nThe second new thing here that you may have noticed is our use of a function. Functions are a BIG DEAL in R. So much so that R is called a functional language. You don’t really need to know all the details of what that means; however, you should know that, in general, everything you do in R you will do with a function. By contrast, everything you create in R will be an object. If you wanted to make an analogy between the R language and the English language, functions are verbs – they do things – and objects are nouns – they are things. This may be confusing right now. Don’t worry. It will become clearer soon.\nMost functions in R begin with the function name followed by parentheses. For example, seq(), sum(), and mean().\nQuestion: What is the name of the function we used in the example above?\nIt’s the seq() function – short for sequence. Inside the function, you may notice that there are three pairs of words, equal symbols, and numbers that are separated by commas. They are, from = 2, to = 100, and by = 2. In this case, from, to, and by are all arguments to the seq() function. I don’t know why they are called arguments, but as far as we are concerned, they just are. We will learn more about functions and arguments later, but for now just know that arguments give functions the information they need to give us the result we want.\nIn this case, the seq() function gives us a sequence of numbers, but we have to give it information about where that sequence should start, where it should end, and how many steps should be in the middle. Here the sequence begins with the value we gave to the from argument (i.e., 2), ends with the value we gave to the to argument (i.e., 100), and increases at each step by the number we gave to the by argument (i.e., 2). So, 2, 4, 6, 8 … 100.\nWhile it’s convenient, let’s also learn some programming terminology:\n🗒Side Note: The seq() function isn’t particularly important or noteworthy. I essentially chose it at random to illustrate some key points. However, arguments, passing values, and return values are extremely important concepts and we will return to them many times.",

    "text": "3.2 The environment pane\nThe second pane we are going to talk about is the Environment/History/Connections pane. @ref(fig:environment-pane) However, we will mostly refer to it as the Environment pane and we will mostly ignore the History and Connections tab. We aren’t ignoring them because they aren’t useful; rather, we are ignoring them because using them isn’t essential for anything we will discuss anytime soon, and I want to keep things as simple as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment pane.\n\n\n\n\nThe Environment pane shows you all the objects that R can currently use for data management or analysis. In this picture, @ref(fig:environment-pane) our environment is empty. Let’s create an object and add it to our Environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vector x in the global environment.\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that we created a new object called x, which now appears in our Global Environment. @ref(fig:environment-pane2) This gives us another great opportunity to discuss some new concepts.\nFirst, we created the x object in the Console by assigning the value 2 to the letter x. We did this by typing “x” followed by a less than symbol (&lt;), a dash symbol (-), and the number 2. R is kind of unique in this way. I have never seen another programming language (although I’m sure they are out there) that uses &lt;- to assign values to variables. By the way, &lt;- is called the assignment operator (or assignment arrow), and ”assign” here means “make x contain 2” or “put 2 inside x.”\nIn many other languages you would write that as x = 2. But, for whatever reason, in R it is &lt;-. Unfortunately, &lt;- is more awkward to type than =. Fortunately, RStudio gives us a keyboard shortcut to make it easier. To type the assignment operator in RStudio, just hold down Option + - (dash key) on a Mac or Alt + - (dash key) on a PC and RStudio will insert &lt;- complete with spaces on either side of the arrow. This may still seem awkward at first, but you will get used to it.\n\n🗒Side Note: A note about using the letter “x”: By convention, the letter “x” is a widely used variable name. You will see it used a lot in example documents and online. However, there is nothing special about the letter x. We could have just as easily used any other letter (a &lt;- 2), word (variable &lt;- 2), or descriptive name (my_favorite_number &lt;- 2) that is allowed by R.\n\nSecond, you can see that our Global Environment now includes the object x, which has a value of 2. In this case, we would say that x is a numeric vector of length 1 (i.e., it has one value stored in it). We will talk more about vectors and vector types soon. For now, just notice that objects that you can manipulate or analyze in R will appear in your Global Environment.\n\n⚠️Warning: R is a case sensitive language. That means that uppercase x (X) and lowercase x (x) are different things to R. So, if you assign 2 to lower case x (x &lt;- 2). And then later ask R to tell what number you stored in uppercase X, you will get an error (Error: object 'X' not found).",

For us, the files tab and the help tab will probably be the most useful. You can think of the files tab as a mini Finder window (for Mac) or a mini File Explorer window (for PC). The help tab is also extremely useful once you get acclimated to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe help tab.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in the screenshot above @ref(fig:help) we typed the seq into the search bar. The help pane then shows us a page of documentation for the seq() function. The documentation includes a brief description of what the function does, outlines all the arguments the seq() function recognizes, and, if you scroll down, gives examples of using the seq() function. Admittedly, this help documentation can seem a little like reading Greek (assuming you don’t speak Greek) at first. But, you will get more comfortable using it with practice.

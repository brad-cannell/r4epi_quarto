# Glossary {#sec-glossary}

**Console**. Coming soon.

**Data frame**. For our purposes, data frames are just R's term for data set or data table. Data frames are made up of columns (variables) and rows (observations). In R, all columns of a data frame must have the same length.

**Functions**. Coming soon.

  * **Arguments:** Arguments always go _inside_ the parentheses of a function and give the function the information it needs to give us the result we want.   

  * **Pass:** In programming lingo, you _pass_ a value to a function argument. For example, in the funtion call `seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 2)` we could say that we passed a value of 2 to the `from` argument, we passed a value of 100 to the `to` argument, and we passed a value of 2 to the `by` argument.  

  * **Returns:** Instead of saying, “the `seq()` function _gives us_ a sequence of numbers…” we could say, “the `seq()` function _returns_ us a sequence of numbers…” In programming lingo, functions _return_ one or more results.  
  
**Global environment**. Coming soon.

[Issue (GitHub)]{#glossary-issue}

:  GitHub's documentation says issues are "items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work. Issues are simple to create and flexible to suit a variety of scenarios. You can use issues to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks, and efficiently communicate with others."@GitHub2024-im

**Objects**. Coming soon.

[R]{#glossary-r} 

:  R's documentation says "R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues."@R_Core_Team2024-sk R is open source, and you can download it for free from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://cran.r-project.org/.
  
[Repository]{#glossary-repository} 

:  GitHub's documentation says "a repository contains all of your code, your files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository."@GitHub2023-tt A repository can exist _locally_ as a set of files on your computer. A repository can also exist _remotely_ as a set of files on a sever somewhere, for example, on GitHub.

[RStudio]{#glossary-rstudio} 

:  RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux). @RStudio2020-fe

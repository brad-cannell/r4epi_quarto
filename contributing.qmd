# Contributing {.unnumbered}

Over the years, we have learned so much from our students and colleagues, and we anticipate that there is much more we can learn from you -- our readers. Therefore, we welcome and appreciate all constructive contributions to R4Epi!

## Typos {.unnumbered}

The easiest way for you to contribute is to help us clean up the little typos and grammatical errors that inevitably sneak into the text. 

If you spot a typo, you can offer a correction directly in GitHub. You will first need to create a free GitHub account: [sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/join). Later in the book, we will cover using [GitHub in greater depth][Introduction to git and GitHub]. Here, we're just going to walk you through how to fix a typo without much explanation of how GitHub works.

Let's say you spot a typo while reading along.
